This is a fork of kernc's backtesting.py repo.

Backtest trading strategies with Python.

For usage and documentation, please refer to the original websites. There should be very little difference between the original and this forked version.

[WIP] The main difference is that this fork allows for fractional unit of asset to be traded, which greatly benefit cryptocurrency.
